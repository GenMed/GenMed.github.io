Welcome to the website of the GenMedML group at the University of Jordan. In our group, we aim to solve BioMedical  problems using machine learning techniques. We are particularly interested in the relationship between Transformers in Language-Vision modalities, structure and function. Our group is led by [Wouter Boomsma](https://GenMed.github.io//people/#wouter) and consists of people with a broad range of interests and expertise. </br> </br>
Please have a look around on our website! </br>
Meet our [group members](https://GenMed.github.io//people/), check out the latest [news](https://GenMed.github.io//news/) and [publications](https://GenMed.github.io//publications) and feel free to [contact us](https://GenMed.github.io//contact/).
